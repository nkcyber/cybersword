## Service Deployment

Note that [automatic challenge deployment](https://docs.ctfd.io/tutorials/challenges/deploying-challenges/#automatic-challenge-deployment-service) is not available in the free version, which we're using.

As such, we have to take a more involved approach to challenge service deployment.
