  Your machine has been equiped with the office's powerful document viewer.

  You can view your documents by going to <a href="/document-viewer" target="_blank">`/document-viewer`</a>

  You have been given the access code `General`.

  See how the SQL Query changes based on the text you enter.

  There is a document called "Flag #1" with a security code that we don't know.

  Can you craft a SQL injection so that the `WHERE` clause is always true, and all of the documents are returned?

          Facts about SQL:
          - `1` is always true
          - `0` is always false
          - `X AND Y` needs X and Y to be true
          - `X OR Y` needs X or Y to be true
          - `--` comments the rest of a line
          ```
